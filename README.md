# TestIt Conversational Platform Skeleton

<<AC_ANCHOR|DOC|META|readme@v1>>
This repository hosts the evolving architecture and documentation skeleton for an
industrial-grade conversational platform featuring an extensible plugin
ecosystem. The current milestone focuses exclusively on documentation and
process scaffolding to accelerate future implementation sessions.
<</AC_ANCHOR|DOC|META|readme@v1>>

## Purpose of This Snapshot
- Establish the single source of truth (SSOT) anchors, registries, and
  protocols mandated by the AC/Universal framework.
- Provide templated directories for core services, plugins, adapters, and
  operational tooling without committing executable logic.
- Enable upcoming architect, developer, and tester roles to work
  independently while preserving stigmergic alignment.

## Repository Layout (High-Level)
See `/docs/meta/anchors.md` for the authoritative list of anchors and SSOT
references. Information here may become outdated; always verify against the
referenced files. <<AC_ANCHOR|DOC|SOT|index-ref@v1>>SSOT index<<AC_SOT_LINK:/docs/sot/index.md>>

## Next Steps
Future sessions should:
1. Refine contracts before adding implementation artifacts.
2. Flesh out roadmap entries into actionable MR-sized tasks.
3. Keep metrics, triggers, and protocols aligned with active workstreams.

## Licensing and Governance
Placeholder sections for licensing, contribution guidelines, security posture,
and community standards exist but require content in later iterations.
